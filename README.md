# 🌟 MVC Framework - Java Web Application Architecture 🌟

The MVC Framework is a Java-based architecture framework designed to facilitate the development of web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This framework aims to separate the application's logic, views, and control flow to enhance code management and application scalability.

## 📋 Overview
MVC Framework is a simple yet powerful solution for managing Java web applications. It helps in organizing the application by dividing it into three core components:
- **Model**: Handles data logic and business entities.
- **View**: Manages user interface and data presentation.
- **Controller**: Processes user input, interacts with the model, and updates the view.

## 📌 Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the application’s logic, presentation, and control separate, improving maintainability and readability.
- **Routing Management**: Provides routing management to handle user requests and navigate to the appropriate controllers.
- **Model-View-Controller Integration**: Facilitates smooth communication between the data layer (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (Controller).
- **Java 17 Support**: Leverages the latest features of Java 17 for improved performance and security.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: With clear separation, the application is easy to scale and maintain as it grows.
